How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Because, if you programmer and you are working with thousand of codes  it's easy to make a mistake when you made a new changes to the code. So that why the version-control comes from, to help programmer track their changes to the code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Ya gitulah ahahhaha

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Karena GIT itu ditujukan untuk programmer yang tentu saja mengakses banyak files sekaligus, yang behubungan satu sama lainnya. Sementara Google docs hanya bisa melakukan pengeditan paddasingle dokumen pada satu waktu

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

jawabanya malah ada dipertanyaanya sendiri wkwkwkw :), funny

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Mboh 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

buat projeklah masa iya buat makan bro wkwkwkwkwk
